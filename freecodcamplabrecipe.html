    <p>
      Francesinha is one of Portugal’s most iconic and indulgent dishes, originating from the city of Porto. 
      Rich, hearty, and full of bold flavors, it is a true comfort food classic.
    </p>

    <p>
      At its core, a Francesinha is a layered sandwich made with toasted bread, filled with steak, fresh sausage, 
      linguiça, ham, and mortadella. The sandwich is then completely covered with melted cheese and topped with a fried egg.
    </p>

    <p>
      What truly defines the dish is its signature sauce — a hot, flavorful blend made with beer, tomato, 
      Port wine, whisky, spices, and chili. The sauce is poured generously over the sandwich, soaking into 
      the layers and creating its unmistakable taste.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is traditionally served with French fries on the side, often used to dip into the rich sauce.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hearty, slightly spicy, and deeply satisfying, the Francesinha is more than just a sandwich — 
      it’s a full meal experience and a symbol of Porto’s culinary identity.
